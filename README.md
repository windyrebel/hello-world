# hello-world

Hello everyone,

I am WindyRebel. As of Sept 2021, I am currently working as an SEO Manager by day and am self-teaching front-end development at night. I hope to create some cool things as I learn along the way. I love solving problems, so here I go!

Edit 1: So, I decided to re-visit the tutorial without to see if I could complete a pull and merge.
